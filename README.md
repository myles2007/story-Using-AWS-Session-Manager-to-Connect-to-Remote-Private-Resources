# Welcome

This project is intended to be used alongside my series of Medium stories under
umbrella title:

"Using AWS Session Manager to Connec to Remote, Private Resources"

At this time, it covers:
 - [Using AWS SSM Session Manager to Connect to Private Resources: Leveraging the `start-session` command](https://medium.com/@mylesloffler/using-aws-ssm-session-manager-to-connect-to-private-resources-a0933b4dc6e3)
 - [Using AWS SSM Session Manager to Connect to Private Resources: Port Forwarding Edition](https://medium.com/@mylesloffler/using-aws-ssm-session-manager-to-connect-to-private-resources-3083f55e3f16)

 Each story has its own branch which contains the code necessary to deploy the described solution. Branches will be similar to each other, but will contain different resources depending on the needs of the story.
